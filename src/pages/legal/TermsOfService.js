                <li>
                  LEMOX has entered into a separate contractual agreement , according to which LEMOX provides certain
                  services relating to the subscription of Financial Instruments via the Platform.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Platform enables a Registered User to subscribe to the Financial Instruments issued by LEMOX . In
                  this context, LEMOX merely provides an access to the Platform and will not be a party to the
                  subscription agreements entered.
                </li>
                <li>
                  LEMOX does not provide any investment advice or tax advice and more generally does not provide any
                  financial regulated services. Before subscribing to the Lemox tokens, Registered Users are recommended
                  to obtain advice from appropriately qualified experts.

                <li>
                  (1) Registered Users may only subscribe to Financial Instruments of LEMOX in the form of tokenized
                  securities, via the LEMOX Platform, after having completed the identification procedure as set out
                  above.
                </li>
                <li>
                  (2) There is a time limit for the acquisition of the Financial Instruments. The Issuer and LEMOX
                  reserve the right to change the time limit at any time. There is also the right to terminate the offer
                  prematurely, if there is a full placement. In the event of an over- placement, the first
                  come-first-served principle shall apply, whereby the completion of the contract shall be decisive. If
                  a subscription amount exceeds the available volume of the Financial Instrument, the Issuer may reduce
                  the subscription amount in accordance with the volume still available.
                </li>
                <li>
                  (3) When making an investment decision, the Registered User is fully responsible for obtaining and
                  reviewing information. Thus, the Registered User is obliged to conduct an intensive review of all
                  documents, risks and other circumstances relating to the Financial Instrument before subscribing to a
                  Financial Instrument, so that a decision to subscribe to a capital investment is made solely and, on
                  the Registered User’s own responsibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                  (4) For the successful conclusion of a subscription for the acquisition of a Financial Instrument, it
                  is necessary that the Registered User completes all electronic form pages in the subscription process
                  on the Platform completely and truthfully and completes the process on the overview at the end of the
                  subscription process.
                </li>
                <li>
                  (5) The Issuer or a third party appointed by it retains the right to accept the Registered User's
                  subscription declaration in whole or in part, with the exception that the Terms and Conditions of the
                  respective investment expressly stipulate otherwise.
                </li>
                <li>

                  subscription, the conclusion of the contract as well as the further conditions and restrictions of
                  acquisition will be set out within further contracts and contractual conditions and restrictions will
                  be disclosed and confirmed by the Registered User, including but not limited to the offering
                  memorandum of the Financial Instruments, the articles of LEMOX and the subscription note.
                </li>
                <li>
                  (7) Lemox shall only be liable in case of willful misconduct or gross negligence arising in the
                  context of the contractual relationship entered into with the Registered Users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  (8) LEMOX or the Issuer shall not be liable to the Registered User for any tax, economic or legal
                  objectives pursued in connection with the respective investments, in particular not for the success of
                  the respective Financial Instruments or compliance with forecasts made in connection with the

                  partial or complete loss of the invested capital in the event of a negative development. The capital
