            <p>
              Anyone can invest a certain amount and become a partial owner of a property and benefit from the potential
              profits. Moreover, tokens can be purchased and sold on secondary markets. The property owner can also sell
              some part of their assets by issuing tokens.

            <p>
              Property tokenization, like any type of tokenization, eliminates barriers related to location. Nothing
              prevents you from buying a property on the other side of the world in the middle of the night. You can
              participate in and profit from the construction of resorts, housing estates, or rentals anytime and
              anywhere.{' '}

            <p>
              The most effective optimization of any activity is to limit unnecessary expenditures by acting within the
              legal framework. Blockchain technology enables this by removing barriers like notary fees and bank fees
              (paying for your property with cryptocurrencies helps you get around them).{' '}

            <h3 className="display-5 mb-4">Low Entry Barriers</h3>
            <p>
              With each token representing a fraction of real estate, a larger pool of investors gets a chance to
              participate since the minimum size of investment is significantly reduced.

              {' '}
              Once a property is tokenized, all the information (its value, size, location, ownership, and loans against
              it) is recorded on the blockchain. This means that transactions can run smoother with less paperwork
              needed.{' '}

            <p>
              Tokenization solves the biggest issue of real estate which is the liquidity of the asset. In the
              traditional way, various parties are involved in the legal transfer of assets, while tokenization
              simplifies buying and selling properties. It omits the middle man and allows ownership to be transferred
              directly from investor to investor and there is more room for fractional ownership.{' '}
